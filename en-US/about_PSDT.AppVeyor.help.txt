SHORT DESCRIPTION
        PSDT.AppVeyor is a collection of PowerShell cmdlets, which helps managing builds and releases using AppVeyor: https://www.appveyor.com/.

LONG DESCRIPTION
        The PowerShell Developer Tools for AppVeyor simplifies accessing AppVeyor REST Api and managing build configurations.
        
        PSDT.AppVeyor is shipped with a built-in (nested) module, which is intended to encapsulate 
        general PSDT application logic.
         
        The following functionality is supported:
        
        * Find the last build of a build definition (aka AppVeyor Project)
        * Reset build number daily, in order to use it as revision number
        * PSScriptAnalyzer logic encapsulation, to enable reusability over AppVeyor Projects
        * Encapsulate logic, how we version and publish our packages during build
